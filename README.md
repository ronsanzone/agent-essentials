# Claude Essentials

A collection of Claude Code customizations including global instructions, skills, and utility scripts for enhanced AI-assisted development.

## Skills Overview

### Deep-Work Pipeline Orchestrator

Runs the full deep-work pipeline (Phases 1-6) in a single session using agent teams with configurable review gates between each phase.

> **Note:** The individual deep-work phase skills (`dw-01` through `dw-06`) and the RPI skills (`rpi-research`, `rpi-plan`, `rpi-implement`) have moved to the [context-engineering-workflows](https://github.com/ronsanzone/context-engineering-workflows) repo. This repo retains only the single-session orchestrator (`/deep-work-pipeline`) that coordinates the phases.

### Code Review & PR Skills

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **quick-review** | `/quick-review` | Single-pass expert review with severity-ranked findings (critical → minor) |
| **local-code-review** | `/local-code-review` | Local code review of changes in the working tree |
| **submit-pr** | `/submit-pr` | Full PR submission workflow — creates draft PRs or pushes updates to existing ones |
| **yeet** | `/yeet [ticket-key\|ticket-title]` | One-shot shipping workflow — creates/uses Jira ticket, commits relevant local changes, pushes, and opens/updates a draft PR |

### Workflow Skills

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **refine-ticket** | `/refine-ticket` | Interactively refine a Jira ticket, pasted text, or file into a structured `ticket.md` |
| **investigate-and-fix** | `/investigate-and-fix <ticket>` | Single-session alternative to the full pipeline — investigate, research, propose, plan, and implement for well-scoped bug fixes or small features |
| **session-retrospective** | `/session-retrospective` | Analyze session process efficiency — scores context engineering, tool usage, sub-agent work, and cost efficiency (1-5) |

---

### Reporting & Presentation

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **code-tour** | `/code-tour` | Generate an interactive HTML tour of a codebase or feature area |
| **html-report** | `/html-report` | Render compiled content as a self-contained HTML technical report with TOC, scroll-spy, and collapsible sections |
